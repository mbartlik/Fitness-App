# IOS Fitness App

## Description
This is an iOS workout app designed in XCode using swift. It allows users to design workouts with an order of exercises where each exercise has a certain amount of time to complete. A user can run a workout and then the app will sequentially display exercises along with a countdown timer. When the timer expires, it will go on to the next exercise.
